# DBF X1 Plane – AIAA Design Build Fly Competition Entry

## ✈️ Overview
This was a project I contributed towards for my DBF (Design, Build, Fly) club. Essentially, DBF is a club were design, build, and fly our own self made plane to compete in an AIAA competition. This project was built for the 2025 AIAA Design/Build/Fly competition, which tasked university teams with designing and fabricating an RC aircraft capable of deploying an autonomous glider ("X-1 test vehicle") mid-flight. The aircraft had to complete multiple missions involving payload transport, mid-air deployment, and ground assembly, all under strict design, weight, and flight constraints. <br />
My job for this competition was to work with our aerodynamics team lead to assemble and configure our flight controller to navigate its way to a certain waypoint, and to design a circuit to communicate to the flight controller that it had been released from the main RC plane.
